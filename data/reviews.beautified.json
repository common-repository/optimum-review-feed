The wines areso well matched with the food that you,don't even need to worry about the cost,because you're really missing out if you don't have the wines to accompany the courses that you have chosen. We had the smoked salmon beautiful  followed by the lemon sole exceptional  and the rhubarb tart  I never thought that a tart could be so delicate,refreshing and melt in the mouth. Ended with a great Americano coffee . All in all a greatexperience. I'll just have to win the lottery and come back soon!",
