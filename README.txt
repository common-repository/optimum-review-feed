Optimum Review Feed is a review feed widget that shows your business's latest public reviews, gathered by OptimumFeedback.com from review platforms.

== Description ==

This widget gathers your business's latest reviews automatically from public review platforms, such as Yelp, Google Reviews, Tripadvisor and many others.

You can display the widget on any page or post on your site, and configure it to show as many or as few reviews as you wish.

The widget also has a built-in filter, allowing you to only show reviews that are above a certain star-rating (e.g. only 4- and 5-star reviews).

The plugin works in conjunction with [OptimumFeedback.com](http://optimumfeedback.com "Optimum Feedback") and requires an Optimum Feedback account to work.
